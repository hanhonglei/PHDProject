                           The Earth as an Arcball

 This is a small demonstration I wrote to test my arcball. Ssee the
 included files arcball.cpp, and arcball.h for relevant source code.
 For a quick look at the arcball, hit P to pause rotation, then click
 on a point on the globe; see how you can drag that point to another
 location on the sphere. That is the nature of arcball rotation, it
 determines the location of one particular point on the sphere. Please
 see my website for a thorough description of the arcball.

 Keyboard commands:

   P - Pause rotation.
   W - Toggle wireframe.
   L - Toggle lighting.
   S - Toggle stars.
   C - Toggle clouds.
   X - Toggle control style (arcball or trackball)
 +/- - Zoom in or out.
 [/] - Adjust rotation speed.
 {/} - Adjust polygon detail level.
 (/) - Adjust cloud level.
 ESC - Quit

 Run with a 256x256 24bit BMP filename as an argument to use a custom texture.

 This is a demonstration of a few ideas:

 1. Arcball

    This is easily accomplished by first using gluUnProject to find
    a ray from the eye to a point under the mouse in the scene, then
    using the cross product of the starting mouse point and the
    current mouse position as an axis of rotation, I rotate the
    earth to keep that point under the mouse. When off the edge of
    the sphere I instead map that point to the plane that intersects
    the sphere's visible edge, thus avoiding a swift motion at the
    edges.

    Alternatively, by pressing X, you may rotate the Earth like
    a trackball, which is similar to the arcball principle, but
    instead uses horizontal or vertical axis of rotation. This serves
    as a very good test of the quaternion calculation's stability,
    as a trackball's rotation may never be based on single starting
    vector, but rather must be renewed at every position (trackball
    motion by its nature does not preserve the location of a
    point under the mouse).

 2. Stars at Infinite Distance

    This was accomplished by putting the stars on a sphere centred on
    the camera, rather than centred on the earth, thus giving them the
    appearance of infinite distance. (The rendering is done in two
    passes, one to generate the star background, then the depth
    buffer is cleared, the projection matrix reset, and the
    earth is drawn.)

 3. Perlin Noise

    I used Perlin Noise to form the clouds. This was simple to produce:
    take a regular field of white noise, and pass a convolution filter
    over them (e.g. average every pixel with a 10x10 block of its neighbours,
    which can be done with the row of 10 first, then a column, to save
    redundant calculation), then add a smaller amount of noise on top of this
    that has been similarly filtered, but with a less powerful filter.
    What happens is that the noise has a well behaved harmonic spectrum,
    giving much power to the large details (cloud shape), while letting
    the high frequency noises provide smaller details ("texture"). These
    particular clouds were more low frequency noise in the horizontal
    direction to make them more horizontally shaped.
